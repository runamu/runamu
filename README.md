### Hi there 👋

Welcome to Yeda Song's GitHub repository!

I’m a Master's student in the Interdisciplinary Program in AI at Seoul National University (SNU IPAI), under the supervision of [Gunhee Kim](https://vision.snu.ac.kr/gunhee/).

My research interest lies in deep reinforcement learning (RL), particularly in devising intelligent agents capable of solving novel tasks. I believe such a goal can be achieved by learning proper abstractions, utilizing language models, and taking model-based approaches.

If you want to learn more about me:
