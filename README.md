### Hi There 👋

Thank you for visiting my GitHub repository!

<!--
My name is **Yeda Song**, and I am a PhD student in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Michigan. I have the honor of being supervised by Prof. [Honglak Lee](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~honglak/).
I received my M.S. in Artificial Intelligence at Seoul National University, under the supervision of Prof. [Gunhee Kim](https://vision.snu.ac.kr/gunhee/).

My research goal is to develop generalizable agents for real-world settings. I am particularly interested in combining deep reinforcement learning (RL) with vision-language models.
